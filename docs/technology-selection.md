# Smart Urban Farming – Technology Selection

## Overview

The Smart Urban Farming project is designed to be modular, scalable, and suitable for future research and real-world implementation.  
The technology stack and data sources were selected based on availability, scalability, ease of integration, and long-term sustainability.

The system is built to support a functional MVP (Version 1) while allowing expansion into AI-based plant monitoring and smart agriculture systems in later versions.

## Technology Stack

### Backend Framework: FastAPI

#### Why FastAPI was chosen

- Lightweight and fast performance
- Easy REST API development
- Strong Python ecosystem
- Good integration with machine learning libraries
- Simple database connectivity
- Suitable for modular and scalable systems
- Easy deployment to cloud environments

#### Role in the Project

- Plant API endpoints
- User plant tracking
- Plant recommendation system
- Communication between frontend and database
- Data processing layer

#### Future Expansion

- Microservices architecture
- AI model integration
- IoT system integration
- Cloud deployment (Docker or VPS)

## Database Selection

### PostgreSQL (Primary Database)

#### Why PostgreSQL was chosen

- Free and open source
- Highly reliable and stable
- Supports complex queries
- Strong data integrity
- Scalable for large datasets
- Widely used in research and production systems
- Supports structured and semi-structured data
- Compatible with AI and data analytics workflows
- Supports spatial and environmental data (GIS)

#### Role in Version 1

- Store plant data
- Store user plant collections
- Store watering requirements
- Store sunlight requirements
- Store plant growth tracking
- Store plant care schedules

#### Role in Version 2 and Version 3

- Environmental sensor data
- Smart irrigation data
- AI plant recommendation system
- Growth prediction data
